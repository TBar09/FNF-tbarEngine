# TBar-Engine
--When 3D and Psych Engine combine--
T-Bar Engine is a 0.6.3 Psych Engine fork that adds 3D model support + some Codename Engine quality-of-life features.
Features from both 0.7.3 Psych Engine and Codename Engine, while also adding entirely new features into the mix.
This Psych fork is meant to be used for both softmodding and source coding too!

# Features
## Away3D
The big one: 3D model support! Using haxe scripting and/or runHaxeCode, you can add your own 3D models into the game, which is fully compatible with the mods folder, 
so you can make modpacks with 3d environments.

## Haxe Scripting
You can now use haxe scripts as an alternative to lua scripting. Haxe scripts use the same callback names as Psych (example: onCreate, onUpdate, goodNoteHit, etc)
while also using some functionalities from Codename scripting, adding functions from newer Psych versions, and adding original functionalities. Haxe scripts also
have more uses than base lua scripts, like editing other menus!

##Softcoded Menus
Using haxe scripting and the "states" folder in your modpack, you can modify existing menus and even make your own menus for your modpacks! 
See [unfinished] for the api on all the callbacks and menu specific callbacks.

## More Lua Functions
Lua Scripts have way more lua functions added, some from 0.7.3 and even some completely new ones!

Example:
```
setWindowColorMode(true, hasWindowsVersion("10"))
getDataFromURL('https://www.youtube.com')
doTweenNumber('coolTween', 1, 45, 3, 'sineInOut')

makeLuaBackdrop("coolBackdrop", "characters/BOYFRIEND", 10, 10, 'x', 0, 0)
addLuaBackdrop("coolBackdrop", true)
```

There are even hardcoded versions of [Ghostutil](https://github.com/AlsoGhostglowDev/Ghost-s-Utilities) functions!

Example:
```
setWindowProperty('borderless', true)
windowAlert("Hi, I'm a message", "Title Lol")
windowTweenY('windowGoBurY', 100, 7, 'linear')
```

## New Crash Handler
The new crash handler will no longer close the game (unless it's an uncaught error /shrug). Instead, it will reset to the main menu. The crash menu is even
able to be edited by using haxe scripts.

## New Videos Handler
T-Bar Engine now uses hxvlc, making it possible to do unskippable cutscenes, midsong cutscenes, and even play videos from an online source.
Videos are way more higher quality too!

## Installation:
(You must have the components to compile Psych 0.6.3, a list of haxelibs will be made soon)

Some of the libraries use codename forks, so install them using:
```
haxelib git hscript-improved https://github.com/CodenameCrew/hscript-improved
haxelib git hxdiscord_rpc https://github.com/CodenameCrew/hxdiscord_rpc
haxelib git away3d https://github.com/CodenameCrew/away3d
```

For videos, run:
```
haxelib install hxvlc 1.9.2
```

# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

open up a Command Prompt/PowerShell or Terminal, type `haxelib install hmm`

after it finishes, simply type `haxelib run hmm install` in order to install all the needed libraries for *Psych Engine!*

## Customization:

if you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can read over to `Project.xml`

inside `Project.xml`, you will find several variables to customize Psych Engine to your liking

to start you off, disabling Videos should be simple, simply Delete the line `"VIDEOS_ALLOWED"` or comment it out by wrapping the line in XML-like comments, like this `<!-- YOUR_LINE_HERE -->`

same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.xml` file

## Mod Support
* Probably one of the main points of this engine, you can code in .lua files outside of the source code, making your own weeks without even messing with the source!
* Comes with a Mod Organizing/Disabling Menu.


## Atleast one change to every week:
### Week 1:
  * New Dad Left sing sprite
  * Unused stage lights are now used
### Week 2:
  * Both BF and Skid & Pump does "Hey!" animations
  * Thunders does a quick light flash and zooms the camera in slightly
  * Added a quick transition/cutscene to Monster
### Week 3:
  * BF does "Hey!" during Philly Nice
  * Blammed has a cool new colors flash during that sick part of the song
### Week 4:
  * Better hair physics for Mom/Boyfriend (Maybe even slightly better than Week 7's :eyes:)
  * Henchmen die during all songs. Yeah :(
### Week 5:
  * Bottom Boppers and GF does "Hey!" animations during Cocoa and Eggnog
  * On Winter Horrorland, GF bops her head slower in some parts of the song.
### Week 6:
  * On Thorns, the HUD is hidden during the cutscene
  * Also there's the Background girls being spooky during the "Hey!" parts of the Instrumental

## Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes
![](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/blob/main/docs/img/chart.png?raw=true)
* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with two example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.

## Multiple editors to assist you in making your own Mod

* Working both for Source code modding and Downloaded builds!

## Story mode menu rework:
![](https://i.imgur.com/UB2EKpV.png)
* Added a different BG to every song (less Tutorial)
* All menu characters are now in individual spritesheets, makes modding it easier.
