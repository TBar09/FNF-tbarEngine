Preprocessors are conditional clauses that changes compilation, Similar to regular `if()` clauses.
They are usually used like:
```
#if IS_COOL
trace("this is cool");
#else
trace("this isn't cool");
#end
```

Haxe scripting and runHaxeCode also allows for this, and makes it possible to shape your script depending
on a T-Bar Engine build's specs, permissions, and changes (Thanks to @Redar13 for the hscript fork).

You can use this to make your script compatible with multiple engines, for example:

```
#if(TBAR_ENGINE || GHOST_ENGINE)
function onCreate() {
	trace("This is awesome");
}
#elseif CODENAME_ENGINE
function new() {
	trace("This is CNE, awesome");
}
#end
```
In this example, the script checks if the engine is T-Bar Engine, Ghost's Psych Fork, or Codename Engine, and
responds accordingly. 

You can also make your script work with multiple versions, for example:
```
#if(TBAR_ENGINE_VER <= "0.1.5h") //If the T-Bar Engine build is 0.1.5h or under.
import backend.NdllUtil;
#elseif(TBAR_ENGINE_VER == "0.2.0") //If the T-Bar Engine build is 2.0.
import backend.util.NdllUtil;
#elseif CODENAME_ENGINE //Maybe it's Codename Engine?
import funkin.backend.utils.NdllUtil;
#else 
throw "Cannot find an Ndll library to import!";
#end
```
Here, to ensure that our script doesn't break on other versions, it checks the T-Bar Engine version and 
changes the import path so we don't import a class that doesn't exist.

Some of T-Bar Engine's conditionals include:

"MODS_ALLOWED" 		- Whether mods or the mods folder is allowed in the build.

"LUA_ALLOWED"		- Whether lua scripting is allowed.

"HSCRIPT_ALLOWED" 	- Whether haxe scripting is allowed, pretty useless since you wouldn't be running
		    	scripts if it wasn't enabled (originally called HXSCRIPT_ALLOWED in 0.1.5h).

"ACHIEVEMENTS_ALLOWED" 	- Whether achievements are allowed.

"DISCORD_ALLOWED" 	- Whether the Discord API is allowed. this conditional is exclusive to 2.0, so
		    	if you're using 0.1.5h, then use `#if desktop`.

"VIDEOS_ALLOWED" 	- Whether hxvlc/videos are allowed. Usually is disabled on 32bit builds and targets
		 	  other than windows, linux, or android.

"AWAY3D_ALLOWED" 	- Whether away3d and 3D capabilities are supported. Exclusive to 2.0, so if you're
		 	  using 0.1.5h, use `#if away3d`.

"IMPORT_AWAY3D"		- Whether the entire away3d class is imported to expand hscript capabilities with it
		  	(AWAY3D_ALLOWED must be enabled for this).

"NDLL_ALLOWED" 		- Whether ndlls are supported.

...HSCRIPT_ALLOWED must be enabled for the following conditionals:

"SOFTCODED_STATES" 	- Whether state/substate scripts are allowed.
"GLOBAL_SCRIPTS" 	- Whether global scripts are allowed.
"CUSTOM_CLASSES" 	- Whether you can extend classes using custom classes in hscript.

Some of the preprocessors that are exclusive to scripting include:

"TBAR_ENGINE" 		- Whether the build is on T-Bar Engine. Good for making scripts that's compatible with multiple
			engines.
"TBAR_ENGINE_VER"	- The version of T-Bar Engine the target build is on (example: 0.2.0, 0.1.5h).
"BUILD_TARGET" 		- The platform target of the build (like "windows", "macos", "android", etc.).
"INITIAL_STATE"		- The name of the state that the script was created in (For versions under 0.2.0, the full
		  	package was used, like "editors.ChartingState", but in 2.0, it's just the name, like 
		  	"PlayState" or "MainMenuState").
"lua" 			- The current version of the lua interpreter in T-Bar Engine, if lua is allowed.
"luajit" 		- The current version of the luaJIT package in T-Bar Engine, if lua is allowed.
