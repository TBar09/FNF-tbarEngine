Classes that you can import for use in runHaxeCode / Haxe scripts:

-`backend.external.CppBackend` - A backend class that hosts cpp functions. It is not recommended to use this class
directly, but rather to use `backend.util.CppAPI` instead.

-`backend.util.CppAPI` - a cpp backend class.

-`backend.util.CoolUtil` - A class that hosts numerous misc. functions used internally. This class does not need to
be imported as it is apart of the pre-imported list.

-`backend.util.NdllUtil` - A utility class that allows for loading up ndll functions/files on runtime. This is to
allow for custom cpp function running through hscript compared to luajit's ffi. (check if this class is supported
by using the `NDLLS_ALLOWED` preprocessor)
