Haxe scripts and runHaxeCode can use hscript-exclusive metadatas to bypass certain interpreter processes, inject
code into a function/variable, or just set the property of the hscript module. They are usually called by doing
`@:metadataName` followed up with a function/variable for it to inject itself into. Some metadatas (like @:noDebug)
don't inject itself into a variable at all, so you can do something like `@:noDebug 0;` to run it and not inject
it into a specific variable.

Below are the following metadatas available to T-Bar Engine hscript:

`@:bypassAccessor` - If used on a variable that uses `get_variable` and/or `set_variable`, it will bypass these
 getter/setter functions and get/set the variable directly.

`@:ignoreException` - If a script has an error in it, the script will still be ran instead of being removed and 
printing an error.

`@:noDebug` - no debug errors will be printed. Equivelent to `luaDebugMode` in lua (fatal errors that show 
a windows popup will still be ran regardless of this metadata being used).

`@:allowJSON(prop:Bool)` - Will toggle json compatibility depending on if `prop` is true/false. this is set to 
`true` by default in haxe scripts and isn't really useful outside of `runHaxeCode` purposes.
