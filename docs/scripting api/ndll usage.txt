Ndll usage is the equivelant to using FFI in lua scripting (in terms of softcoding, at least) and offers a way to
add / run C++ code in the game. 

For making an ndll, that is a different story, but you can see an ndll example by going to
"https://github.com/CodenameCrew/ndll-example".

So you have your ndll ready for action, now to run it in-game.

In a haxe script, you need to import this class:
```
import backend.util.NdllUtil;

//import backend.NdllUtil; //use this instead if your on T-Bar Engine versions lower than 2.0
```

(note: In version 0.1.5, NdllUtil was preimported into every haxe script.)

Now make a variable like you normally would, except it will be mapped to an ndll function, to do this, simply do:
```
var runNdllFunction:Dynamic = NdllUtil.getFunction(Paths.ndll("ndllname"), "function_name", numberOfArguments);
```

please note that unlike in Codename Engine, you will have to put `Paths.ndll()` along with your ndll name into
the first argument.
