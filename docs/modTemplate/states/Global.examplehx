/**
 * A global menu script that runs across the whole game until it's corresponding modpack is disabled.
 * (NOTE: Global scripts are still a bit buggy. They are at a usable state, but if you want to play it safe, then it's best to not use it.)
 
 * It's also important to note that only ONE global script is allowed at a time, and it's usually from the global/topmost modpack.
