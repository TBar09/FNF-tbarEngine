Drop your custom global script & state scripts here!

When a state is loaded, it's respective folder (ex: if MainMenuState is loaded, then all scripts
in the MainMenuState folder will be loaded) containing hscripts will be loaded.

The same applies to substates and ModScriptStates.

(It is recommended to create mod states instead of building off of existing states for more freedom.)
